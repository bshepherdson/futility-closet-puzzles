## Episode 39 - Lateral Thinking Puzzles

### Puzzle 1

- Greg reading, Sharon guessing.
- Segment begins 2:30.
- Puzzle begins 2:42, duration 0:47.
- Source: Not mentioned.
- True story.

During World War 2, German anti-aircraft fire was inflicting heavy losses on
Allied bombers. Officials wanted to protect the planes with armour, but
armouring an entire aircraft would make it too heavy to fly. So they made a
study of returning planes, noted the areas that showed the most damage, and
planned to armour those areas. A mathematician considered this plan and
suggested an alternative that would produce a better outcome. What was it?


<div id="sol-39-1" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

Since the returning planes had survived the damage they had suffered, armouring
those areas would not be the best help. Instead, they should armour the areas
that no surviving plane showed damage to, on the theory that damage there tended
to be fatal.

In 2004, the band They Might Be Giants released a song, never before available,
on their new album. Yet if they had owned one of the earlier albums, a fan could
have heard the song in 1999.


<div id="sol-39-2" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The song is simply another reversed. *On Earth, my Nina*, released in 1999 on
the album *Long Tall Weekend* is merely an inversion of *Thunderbird*, which
came out in 2004 on *The Spine*. The songs are exactly the same, except for a
redubbed vocal track for clarity.

Curiously, the song was originally written as *Thunderbird*, and they released
the reversed version first as *On Earth, my Nina*.

Pierre went skydiving near his home in Dallas, Texas. As a result, Pierre saved
his brother's life. Strangely, though, his brother lived in Boston and hadn't
seen or spoken to his brother Pierre for many years. How could this miracle have
taken place?

<div id="sol-39-3" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

Pierre was killed in a skydiving accident, and saved his brother's life because
his organs were now available for transplantation.

If you look at the western edge of South Dakota, where it borders Montana and
Wyoming, you'll see a mostly straight line with a kink of about one mile, where
the borders of Montana and Wyoming don't line up. The kink does not benefit any
of the states, or local landowners, and no other states are involved. Why is the
kink there?


<div id="sol-39-4" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The answer lies in 19th-century surveying accuracy. Two different teams surveyed
the borders. In 1877 one team surveyed the border with Wyoming, and set it. In
1885, another figured the border with Montana. But the two surveys don't line
up. Rather than pay to redo the whole survey, they added the kink.

A dead body lies on the sidewalk. Next to it are a plate and a mint. What
happened?

<div id="sol-39-5" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The mint is the US Mint, responsible for making currency. The plate is an
engraving plate stolen from the mint. The man was shot by security after
stealing the plate.

Herb gets a job in a new city. On the day of his move, Herb causes a traffic jam
without ever leaving his home. How did Herb create such a monumental
disturbance?

<div id="sol-39-6" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

Herb lives on a houseboat. While moving his houseboat, he passed under a
drawbridge. The boat was too big for the bridge, and got stuck. Therefore, Herb
caused a traffic jam (because the bridge was raised for a long time) without
ever leaving his home.
</div>


### Puzzle 7

- Sharon reading, Greg guessing.
- Segment begins 17:08.
- Puzzle begins 17:12, duration 0:45.

- True story.

In 1930, two men drove from New York to Los Angeles, and then back to New York,
in a Ford motor car. The outbound leg of the journey, a total of 3,340 miles,
took them 18 days. They drove on normal roads, and the car was not remarkable.
But because of this journey, these two men hold a world record that endures to
this day. What is it?


<div id="sol-39-7" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

They drove backwards. It's the fastest speed across the United States in
reverse. (Average speed about 10 miles per hour.)

They traveled day and night, sleeping in a customized seat in the car.
</div>



### Puzzle 8

Mr. and Mrs. Jones were young and active people. Their next door neighbour, Mrs.
Jackson, was a 93-year-old invalid. One day, they asked her into their house to
do something that neither of them could do. What did they need her to do?


<div id="sol-39-8" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

They needed her to witness the signing of a contract. Since both the Joneses
were party to the contract, they needed an outside witness.
</div>




## Episode 38 - The Thunder Stone

A keen stamp collector who specialized in U.S. stamps saw an advertisement
offering a complete set of early U.S. stamps for a fraction of what it was
worth. He quickly bought it. Although it was a genuine, splendid collection, and
a real bargain, he was angry, not pleased. What was going on?

<div id="sol-38" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

It was his own collection. He had been having an affair, and his wife found out.
She sold his stamps for a fraction of their worth to get back at him.
</div>





## Episode 37 - Edgar Allan Poe's Graveyard Visitor

- Sharon reading, Greg guessing.
- Segment begins 20:35.
- Puzzle begins 21:00, duration 10:40.
- Source: Listener David White

A man enters a monastery, greets the abbot, and begins conversing with the
monks. One of them does not respond, however, which the abbot explains by
telling the visitor that the monk has taken a vow of silence. The visitor thinks
for a moment, then speaks a single word. Nobody says anything, but immediately
the visitor pulls out a gun and shoots the silent monk. Why?

<div id="sol-37" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The visitor is a German Gestapo officer during the Second World War. The
monastery is in Italy, and the abbot and most of the monks are Italian. The monk
the visitor shot was a fleeing American spy. The American doesn't speak Italian,
so the abbot pretends that he has taken a vow of silence. The German visitor
speaks the American's name, he says nothing but visibly reacts to the name, and
the German shoots him.

## Episode 36 - The Great Moon Hoax

- Greg reading, Sharon guessing.

  with it.

A woman puts on a brand new pair of shoes that she hasn't worn before. She goes
to work. She dies. What happened?

<div id="sol-36" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The woman was a circus performer. She was the woman who stands against a
backdrop while a knife-thrower throws knives around her. The extra height from
her new, taller heels put her into the path of a knife.

A man left home on Monday, riding a donkey, to make a pilgrimage to Canterbury.
The jouney took two days. He stayed two days in Canterbury, and the journey home
took another two days. He arrived home on Friday. How?

<div id="sol-35-1" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

Friday is the name of his donkey.
</div>



### Puzzle 2

In the presence of witnesses, a man draws a pistol and shoots his brother dead.
After firing this fatal shot, he drops the gun and bursts into tears. The police
arrive on the scene, establish that the man deliberately murdered his brother,
but don't arrest him. Why not?

<div id="sol-35-2" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The brothers are conjoined, or Siamese, twins. The shooter is planning to commit
suicide, and he shoots his brother first so his brother doesn't have to witness
his death. By the time the police arrive, both brothers are dead, so there's no
one to arrest.
</div>



### Puzzle 3

Two cars made their along a winding country road and came to an abrupt stop at a
park gate. Seven men got out of the cars, and had started along a footpath when
it began to rain. Six of the men began to walk faster to get out of the rain,
but the seventh man couldn't be bothered. Ironically, it was the seventh man who
remained dry while the other six got soaked. Since all seven men arrived at
their destination together, how is this possible?

<div id="sol-35-3" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The seventh man is a corpse in a coffin, being carried by the other six. The
park is a cemetary. So they arrive together, and the seventh man is dry.
</div>



### Puzzle 4

A ship sets out on its maiden voyage. Just before arriving at its destination,
the ship is involved in a serious accident, and wrecked. Although no one is
injured in the wreck, the accident is very costly and highly embarrassing. Later
it turns out that if the owners of the ship hadn't been Americans, the accident
probably would not have happened.

<div id="sol-35-4" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The lateral thinking trick here is to realize that the ship in the story is
actually a spaceship. This is the true story of the Mars Climate Orbiter,
launched in 1998, in order to study the Martian climate and atmosphere. The
ship's voyage of over nine months from Earth to Mars went smoothly, but on
September 23, 1999, as NASA engineers attempted to put the spacecraft into orbit
around Mars, contact with the orbiter was lost.

Over the next two days, NASA tried to regain contact with the spacecraft, but
failed. On September 25 the mission was declared a failure. The investigations
that followed revealed that the orbiter had been inserted into the Martian
atmosphere far closer to the planet than intended. The result was either that
the spacecraft was buffetted and destroyed completely by the atmosphere, or that
it fell out of orbit and drifted out of control toward the Sun.

The most embarrassing discovery, however, was that the accident had happened due
to a simple miscalculation. It turned out that one team working on the orbital
software had made their calculations in metric units, Newtons per second, while
another team had used English units, pounds per second. As a result, the
thrusters putting the ship into orbit had fired with more than four times the
thrust intended, pushing the ship 170km closer to the planet than intended, and
wrecking the spacecraft. The project losses were estimated to be over $327
million.

A man who disliked smoking lit a cigarette in order to reach his goal more
quickly. How did it help?

<div id="sol-35-5" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The man was riding a bus on which smoking was not allowed. The nearest bus stops
before and after his destination were both a long walk away. By lighting the
cigarette as he approached the nearest point to his destination, he contrived to
be kicked off the bus between the stops, close to his destination.

A vandal sprayed purple paint across the back of her new white fur coat. Later,
this saved her life.

<div id="sol-35-6" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The owner of the fur coat is a live baby seal. Her life was saved because the
hunters wouldn't kill her for her painted coat.

A man is lying in bed alone, unable to fall asleep. After some time, he picks up
the phone and makes a call. A few moments later, he hangs up the phone without
saying anything, and falls asleep shortly afterwards. What's going on?

<div id="sol-35-7" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The man is in a hotel. The snoring from the room next door was keeping him up,
so he phoned the room and woke the snorer. He fell asleep quickly in the quiet.

Part of the police manual gives instructions in a language that none of the
policemen speaks. Why?

<div id="sol-34" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The instructions are commands meant to be given by K-9 officers to police dogs.
The dogs are trained in another language, such as German, and the manual teaches
these commands to the officers.

Part of the idea is that this makes it unlikely that a suspect or bystander can
confuse the dog by giving conflicting commands. It may be more that many dogs
are imported having been trained in Germany or elsewhere, and having learned
German commands.
</div>

<div id="followup-34-1" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Follow-up - Episode 36

In 2008, all three of Montana's rabbis were involved in a joint Hanukkah
celebration at the state capitol building. After the ceremony, a Helena police
officer went up to one of the rabbis and introduced his bomb security dog,
Miky. The officer, John Fosket, had been having a problem because Miky had
been trained in Israel and only responded to Hebrew, which Fosket did not
speak.

Foscitt had been given a list of a dozen Hebrew commands, but Miky was not
responding properly. Fosket had tried to use a Hebrew instructional audiobook
from the library to improve his pronunciation, but Miky still wasn't responding
properly.

So Fosket sought out the rabbi, and with his help, improved his pronuciation to
the point where Miky responded fully to his commands.

In Australia, a perfectly good building was demolished, and an almost identical
one erected on exactly the same site. The original building was in good
condition, it had no defects, and there was no issue of safety or planning
permission. Why was it demolished?

<div id="sol-33" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The building was the Australian mint. Enough gold dust from the manufacture of
coins had become impregnated in the walls of the building to make it profitable
to knock it down, harvest the gold, and reconstruct it.

This is sort of based on a true story, but it seems that the value of the gold
was only some $32,000. It's also not clear how to recover the gold dust from the
demolished structure. For the purposes of the puzzle, it's conceivable that
there could be enough gold dust to cover the reconstruction cost.

Why does a man drive his car on a long journey at a steady 15 miles per hour?
The speed limit is well above that, and his car is in full working order and
capable of high speeds.


<div id="sol-32" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The man is a beekeeper. He is carrying a queen bee in the car, and is driving
slowly so that the colony of bees can fly along with the car.

A woman walked up to a man behind a counter and handed him a book. He looked at
it and said "That will be four dollars." She paid the man, and then walked out
without the book. He saw her leave without it, but did not call her back. Why?

<div id="sol-31-1" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The woman was returning an overdue library book, so she paid her late fee and
returned the book.

A bell rings, a man dies, a bell rings.

<div id="sol-31-1" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The man is a blind swimmer training for a competition. He's swimming in the
ocean near the shore, and his trainer is on the beach. The trainer is supposed
to signal him the direction of the shore by ringing a bell. However, the swimmer
hears the bell of a buoy marking a channel farther out to sea, swims out toward
the buoy, and drowns.

One morning, a woman performs three errands: first, she buys a pair of
sunglasses; next, she sells her husband's entire wardrobe at the thrift store;
then she has a meeting with her divorce lawyer. She returns home in the
afternoon to discover her husband's body on the front lawn. How did he die?

<div id="sol-30" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

Early in the winter, after a night of drinking, the husband came home, passed
out on the lawn, froze to death, and was buried by a blizzard overnight. Some
time after his disappearance, his wife assumes he's left her for good, and
starts divorce proceedings.

As the weather warms up, the snow melts that day enough to expose his body and
reveal his fate.

Why did a man go to great trouble to bury in the desert 15 brand new
Mercedes-Benz cars, all greased and wrapped in plastic?

<div id="sol-29" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

This was in the Sinai Peninsula after the Six Day War between Egypt and Israel.
Israel had seized large parts of the desert from Egypt, but it was probable it
would be handed back to Egypt.

Due to import duties, Merdeces cars were much cheaper in Israel than in Egypt.
It was becoming clear that the desert would be returned to Egypt. By burying the
cars and waiting until the border moved across them, they were effectively
exported.

A young woman purchases a car. Soon after, the car is very badly damaged, but
she ends up being quite pleased that this has happened. Why is that?

<div id="sol-28" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The car was damaged when a meteorite fell onto it. This was the Peakskill
Meteorite in 1992, in Peakskill, New York. The car was a 1980 Chevy Malibu the
owner had purchased for $300. The car was wrecked by the 26-pound meteorite. But
she sold the car to the wife of a meteorite collector for $10,000, and the
meteorite itself to a consortium for $69,000.

A man in uniform aims carefully and takes a shot. He hits the target, and in so
doing, saves the lives of thousands of people, including many who are angry with
him. How?


<div id="sol-27" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The man in uniform was college basketball player Mykal Riley. He played for
Alabama State in a game on March 14, 2008 against Mississippi. With two seconds
on the clock, Alabama was trailing 59-56. Riley got the ball and sank a
three-point shot, tying the game. Eight minutes later, a tornado hit the
Georgiadome, where the game was being played. It caused serious structural
damage to the facility, but no one was injured. But if Riley had missed that
shot, fans would have been streaming out of the arena, and many would have been
killed when the tornado touched down.

On the hottest day of the year, an octopus sits in the upper limbs of a tree
near Adelaide, Australia. It arrived there because of a foolish prank committed
by a certain man. After a nationwide search the man is arrested, tried, and
sentenced to 20 years in prison. What crime did the man commit?

<div id="sol-26" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The crime was arson. The man deliberately sets a fire which turns into a large
blaze. Several people are killed, and firefighters use a helicopter with a large
bucket to scoop water from the ocean to dump on the fire. The octopus gets
caught in the bucket and dumped over the fire, ending up in the top of a charred
tree.

### Followup - Episode 27

David Brooks wrote in to point out the Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus. This is a
fictional animal, an octopus that supposedly lives in the trees of the temperate
rainforests of the Pacific Northwest.

It is a hoax developed by a group of education researchers at the University of
Connecticut. They built a detailed website about the supposedly endangered
creature, describing its habits and life cycle. It has photos and testimonials
and so on. It was showed to 7th grade students in Connecticut, to see if they
could detect the hoax. Very few caught on to it, and some even protested that
the octopus was real after being told it was a hoax.

This incident has become a classic example of how straightforward it is to make
a comprehensive, professional and convincing website making any claim at all.
The site had deliberate hints that it was a hoax, such as giving the names of
the tree octopus in Sasquatch and Yeti. But on the whole, it was detailed and
had lots of scientific terms, links to other sites, and so on.

### Followup - Episode 29

Listener Mark Weitzenkamp is an academic advisor for undergraduates. He has two
posters on his walls, both in the WPA poster style of the 1930s. One is a
reproduction of a real WPA poster about a show done as a federal theatre
project, and the other is the Save the Northwest Tree Octopus poster.

In two or three years, only a few students have pointed it out as a joke.

The poster has the image of the octopus in the tree, but it also has the same
design and frame as the real poster, and no marks of humour. The students don't
exactly trust it, but they also don't think to distrust it. It's just another
thing.

A man walks into his back yard in the middle of the night and fires a gun. Due
to his strange behavior, he never sees another sunrise. No, he didn't kill
himself. Can you explain this odd occurrence?

<div id="sol-25" class="fold" markdown="1">

In a public place, a man deliberately exposes a portion of his anatomy to a
horrified crowd of men, women and children. Several children burst into tears,
and one outraged father almost tackles the man. After the incident the man is
dismissed from his job, he receives hate mail, and a local newspaper brands him
a "monster", but there is never any suggestion that he should be prosecuted, and
the police are never involved. Why not?

<div id="sol-24" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The man was playing Santa Claus in a mall. The portion of his anatomy that he
exposed was his chin underneath his false beard.

On the first day of a business trip to Japan, BJ arrives at a large office
building. She has never been there before, and can't read any of the signs.
Without seeing or talking to anyone, she quickly makes her way through a
labyrinth of hallways to arrive at her destination. How?

<div id="sol-23" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

BJ is an architect, and she designed the building. Therefore she knows its
layout well, though she has never been there before.

During the Second World War, there was a footbridge over a ravine between
Germany and Switzerland. It was guarded by a German sentry. His orders were to
shoot anyone trying to escape over the bridge, and to turn back anyone who did
not have a signed authorization to cross. The sentry was on the German side of
the bridge. He sat in a sentry post and came out every 3 minutes to survey the
bridge.

A woman desperately needed to escape from Germany to Switzerland. She could not
possibly get a pass. She knew that she could sneak past the sentry while he was
in the sentry post, but that it would take between 5 and 6 minutes to cross the
entire bridge. There was no place to hide on or under the bridge, so the guard
would be easily able to shoot her if he saw her on the bridge escaping to
Switzerland. How did she escape across the bridge?


<div id="sol-22" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

She snuck past the sentry and hurried across the bridge. She then turned and
started walking back toward the German side. The sentry came out and saw her,
apparently crossing from Switzerland to Germany. She did not have the necessary
papers to enter Germany, so he turned her back across the bridge.

A man tells his nephew that his dog will be shot. The boy is overwhelmed with
grief, but discovers a little later that the dog is fine. What's going on?


<div id="sol-21" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The boy is Jackie Cooper, the child actor of the 1930s. This is during filming
of *Skippy* in 1931. The film was directed by Cooper's uncle, and contains a
scene where Cooper's character had to cry convincingly. Cooper was a skilled
actor, but the scene wasn't working out. He was 9 years old and had brought his
dog to the set.

His uncle arranged for the security guard to take the dog outside while drawing
his gun, and then fire into the air. Cooper sobbed uncontrollably, almost too
much for the scene. His uncle said that if he calmed down and did the scene
quickly, there might still be time to save his dog.

Cooper was nominated for Best Actor, and his uncle *won* Best Director.

A famous artist's work is on exhibition in a city's museum. One night, the
city's two most devious and infamous thieves decide to break in, and each makes
off with one painting. They are both wearing absolutely perfect disguises and
leave no trace except for security camera footage, which is discovered in the
morning. The next day, both men are arrested. How were they caught?


<div id="sol-20" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The two thieves are not working together. Each separately disguises himself,
breaks in, and steals a painting. In order to frame the other, each disguised
himself skillfully as the other thief. So the security footage shows the two
actual thieves, disguised as each other. Both were arrested correctly, though
who actually stole which painting would be a surprise to the authorities.

Bernard was the president of a major Wall Street bank. One morning when he got
on a crowded train he was extremely worried. When the train stopped and he
alighted, he felt sick but was no longer worried. Why not?

<div id="sol-19" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The train is not a conventional train for transportation, but rather a roller
coaster. He had promised to take his nephew on a roller coaster, and the boy was
eager to go, but Bernard hated roller coasters. Hence his worrying, and feeling
sick but no longer worried when the ride was over.

A man wakes up feeling thirsty. He goes downstairs, opens the fridge, gets a
bottle of water from inside it, drinks it, goes upstairs, turns off the light,
and goes to bed. In the morning he finds out hundreds of people died. How did
this happen?


<div id="sol-18" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The man is a lighthouse keeper. When the puzzle says he "turns off the light",
it means *the* light, the light of the lighthouse. Without the guide of the
lighthouse, a ship ran aground and sank, killing hundreds of people.

the cabin. What happened?

<div id="sol-17" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The cabin is not a building, but the cabin of an airplane. The two men are the
pilots of the aircraft, which crashed in the woods, killing them both.

In a certain place, the local authorities, in order to increase tourism, have
made the price of electricity higher. Why?

<div id="sol-16" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The "certain place" is Niagara Falls. The falls are diverted through
hydroelectric generators overnight, generating cheap electricity. Diverting the
falls all the time would lower the price of electricity, but due to the tourist
demand, the falls flow freely during the day.

Canada and the United States in fact have a treaty laying out all the complex
rules for when the falls can be diverted and how much, depending on the tourist
season, etc.

Joan and her boyfriend Fred, who lived in Stockport, were invited and given one
of the ornate, if old-fashioned, bedroom suites for their stay. The party lasted
the whole weekend and was a delightful affair. The catering was superb, and the
congenial atmosphere turned the get-together of old friends into an
unforgettable experience.

On Monday morning, most guests had departed, and Joan
and Fred prepared for their journey home. Having finished their packing, Joan
looked around as if searching for something. She finally turned to Fred and
asked, jokingly, "You haven't by any chance drunk the glass of water on the
dressing table?" Fred nodded, and all of a sudden, pandemonium. Joan had to
phone the automobile association's rescue service. Less than an hour later, an
AA man arrived, hitched their car to his breakdown van, and towed the
embarrassed couple home, where they arrived after a two and a half hour journey.

<div id="sol-15" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The glass contained water, and Joan's contact lenses. Fred swallowed them
along with the water. Joan could not drive safely without them, and Fred did not
know how to drive. The other guests had all departed, so no one else was
available to drive them. Therefore they were compelled to call the AA and get
towed.

Sometime after Salvador Dali's death, his younger brother became famous as a
surrealist painter. This younger brother had great international success, and
the word "genius" was used to describe him. His name was Dali, and he did not
change it. Yet today, the world remembers only one Dali, and few people even
know that he had a brother. Why is this?

<div id="sol-14" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

Two brothers in the same family were both named Salvador Dali. The
elder of them lived only until 7 years of age. 9 months later, his parents had
another son. They also named him Salvador, and this younger brother is the one
the world knows as the surrealist painter Salvador Dali. They were never alive
at the same time.
