## Episode 58 - English as She is Spoke

- Greg reading, Sharon guessing
- Segment begins at 22:50
- Puzzle begins 22:16, duration 6:46
- Source: Listener Lawrence Miller
- Based on a true story

A bank robber, in advance of the robbery, places an ad that includes the
time and place of the robbery and a detailed description of the robber.  The
robber gets away with the crime.  What happened?

<div id="sol-56-1" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

This actually happened in 2008.  A robber took out an ad on Craigslist
offering a day of work for road maintenance workers and asked them all to be
wearing a bright yellow ANSI-certified conspicuity vest, safety googles, and
a respirator mask, all of which the typical freelance road maintenance
worker would own, and coincidentally what the robber wore to the scene.  He
asked them to meet outside the bank - this is the Bank of America branch in
Monroe, Washington - at 11 AM.  They thought they'd get $28.50 an hour for
road work and instead they acted as decoys.  From a witness's point of view,
a bunch of workmen were standing around waiting to start work when one of
them casually walked over to a guard who was unloading money into the bank,
pepper sprayed him, grabbed the money, and ran away. And as far as I can
tell, he was never caught.

He was killed by breakfast.

<div id="sol-57-1" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

He's making breakfast, and like you, he likes a lot of pepper on his eggs,
which causes him to sneeze violently, which starts an avalanche and kills
him.

## Episode 56 - Lateral Thinking Puzzles

### Puzzle 1

- Greg reading, Sharon guessing.
- Segment begins 0:35.
- Puzzle begins 0:48, duration 2:19.
- Source: Listener Paul Capp.
- Based on a true story.

A man competes in a track and field event. After an unusually long time, his
results are announced and posted on the stadium scoreboard. The crowd cheers and
the man celebrates. A short while later, his teammate tells him the result and
the man breaks into tears. Why?


<div id="sol-56-1" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The man is American long jumper Bob Beaman. He was computing in the long jump at
the Mexico City olympics in 1968. Jump distances were normally calculated using
a graduated track next to the landing area, by sliding a marker along it. Beaman 
jumped past the end of this track, and the delay was caused by the need to track
down a tape measure to measure his jump.

The results were posted in meters, which Beaman was not very familiar with. He
knew he had done very well, and celebrated. Later, when a teammate told him the
result in more familiar feet and inches, Beaman collapsed in tears when he
realized he had beaten the world record not by a few inches, but by a huge
margin of nearly two feet. His jump was 890cm, or 29 feet, 2.5 inches. His
record stood for 23 years.

Anne, Ben and Chris are siblings who were conceived on the same day. This year,
Anne will be attending third grade while Ben and Chris attend kindergarten. Why?

<div id="sol-56-2" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

They were conceived in vitro, on the same day. Typically when this is done, many
eggs are fertilized at once, and some are kept on ice for possible future use.

So Anne was born, and then a few years later, her brothers were born. The
brothers were born at the same time, because usually several eggs are implanted
into the mother at the same time, since they're not guaranteed to grow.

(Usually, the three are not considered triplets, just siblings. The two younger
brothers are considered fraternal twins, since they were born at the same time.)

### Puzzle 3

- Based on a true story.

Sometime in the early 20th century, a fire occurred in a crowded theater.
Although the exit doors were not blocked on the outside, the panicked attendees
could not get out of those doors and hundreds of people died from the fire. What
happened to trap everybody in the theater?

<div id="sol-56-3" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The doors opened inwards, into the theater's auditorium. With the panicked crowd
crushing toward the doors, those at the front were unable to pull the doors
inward to open them.

This really happened, at the Iroquois Theater in Chicago, Dec. 30, 1903. After
this incident, building codes were changed so all exit doors had to open
outward and with obvious latches.

To be thorough, there was other badness with some exits in this theater
specifically. Some doors were locked, some blocked by boxes, some had unfamiliar
latching mechanisms. But some doors, alas, were free and open, but could not be
opened with the crowd pressing in.

A woman signs her name on a document. A few months later, she moves into a
richly furnished new home for free. How?


<div id="sol-55" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The woman is elected governor of a state, and moves into the governor's mansion.
The document is her ballot on election day.
</div>


## Episode 54 - Escape from Stalag Luft III

A husband and wife take their RV on a camping trip and start out one morning on
a day-long hike. A few hours into the hike, however, the man falls and severely
injures his leg, making it almost impossible for him to walk. He decides to sit
and wait while his wife returns to the campsite to get help. The wife hikes back
and arrives at the RV several hours later. She opens the door and steps inside,
only to discover her husband already there, lying in the bed, dead. What
happened?


<div id="sol-54" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

He was sitting near an overlook waiting for help. A heavy rainstorm came and he
tried to move somewhere more sheltered, but his bad leg led him to fall off the
cliff, and through the roof of his RV, onto the bed.
</div>


## Episode 53 - The Lost Colony

- Greg reading, Sharon guessing.
- Segment begins 23:16.
- Puzzle begins 23:31, duration 6:29.
- Source: Listener Blaine.
- Based on a true story.

A woman is writing a letter. There is a power failure. She dies. How did she
die?


<div id="sol-53" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The "letter" is a not a document, but a huge letter written in the sky by an
airplane. The plane's engine fails, and she is killed in the crash.

This is based on a true story. Her name was Suzanne Asbury-Oliver, and she was
employed by Pepsi in the 1970s to go around America writing "PEPSI" in the sky.
One day she was at the top of the "E" when the engine failed. She glided safely
back to the airport in reality, but in the grand tradition of lateral thinking
puzzles, this one was adapted to be fatal.

## Episode 52 - Moving Day in New York

- Sharon reading, Greg guessing.
- Segment begins 20:41.
- Puzzle begins 21:03, duration 6:19.

A burglar gets a tip that a particular building has a lot of valuables inside,
so he starts casing the place. On the first night he observes a person arriving
at the building, unlocking a garage door, and going inside. After a few monutes,
the person leaves, closes the door a re-locks it with a padlock, carefully
scrambling the combination.

When the coast is clear the burglar takes a closer look at the lock and sees
that it's a multiple dial combination lock, the kind with several rotating disks
with numbers.

For the next couple of weeks, the burglar continues to observe every night. The
same thing happens: every night a person arrives and follows the same routine.
Finally, one night, after the visitor departs the burglar walks up to the
building, unlocks the combination lock, and robs the place.



<div id="sol-52" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

When the visitor closes the lock on the way out, he carefully scrambles the
dials. When people do this, they reflexively make every digit in the scramble
differ from the correct digit in that position.

So by observing enough scrambled combinations, the burglar can determine the
correct values by a process of elimination.

Eric spends his vacation in the Swiss Alps. Unforuntately, he ends up spending
the greater part of his visit in the hospital, after having taken a nasty spill
while skiing. On his return trip home to the U.S., the authorities do not ask
him to show his passport. Why not?


<div id="sol-51-1" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

Eric died in the hospital of his skiing injuries. His body was repatriated to
the United States, but corpses need not have passports.
</div>


### Puzzle 2

Christopher learns about a terrible crime that has been committed by John and
Bob. He has known both of these men for many years, and cares for them equally.
Why, then, does he only report John to the authorities, and not Bob?

<div id="sol-51-2" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

Christopher is a Catholic priest, and Bob has confessed to him. Confessionals
are privileged, and priests are barred from disclosing the things confessed to
them. Christopher later learns of John's involvement outside of a confession,
and reports John to the authorities.

After drinking some raspberry Kool-Aid, a woman is feeling childish and
nostalgic. She phones her best friend, with whom she has not spoken in 6 months.
Eventually the woman receives an apology from her ten-year-old nephew.


<div id="sol-50" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The nephew had added liquor to the Kool-Aid as a prank. The woman was a
recovering alcoholic, and the friend was her old drinking buddy. They hadn't
spoken since the woman decided to go sober.

Jeff had a problem that required him to have his car towed to the garage. After
his car was dropped off, Jeff walked to a nearby restaurant to have lunch while
he waited. During his lunch, the mechanic at the garage called Jeff and told him
"I'm sorry, I can't seem to find anything wrong with your car." Jeff replied
"Well, I'm not surprised to hear that." After a further explanation from Jeff,
the mechanic said "Oh, I see. Sure, I can get that fixed." A few hours later,
the problem was fixed, and Jeff drove his car back home. What had been fixed?



<div id="sol-49" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

Jeff owns both the car and the tow truck. The car is in perfect order, but the
brakes on his tow truck are failing. Jeff tows his car to the garage, while his wife rides in the car and applies its functioning brakes to supplement the truck's
brakes.

So the mechanic finds no problems with Jeff's car, Jeff explains the confusion,
and the mechanic fixes the truck.

Don't try this at home!

A man dies at a sporting event. Everyone involved is arrested, but no one is
charged with his death. Why?

<div id="sol-48" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The sporting event is a cockfight. Everyone involved is arrested because
cockfighting is illegal. The cocks had sharp blades attached to their legs for
these fights. The man was attacked by one rooster and cut badly in the leg, and
died of the wounds. But no one was directly responsible for his death, so no one
was charged.

In 2012, a soccer match between Brazil and Argentina ended in a tie and went to
a penalty shootout in order to determine the winner. As the shootout began, the
first Brazilian player lined up behind the ball in preparation for his shot. As
he stood there, however, it was clear to everyone that the man was uncertain
about something, and he made no attempt to kick the ball. Suddenly a sharp burst
of noise was heard in the stadium. A few seconds later, the noise was heard
again, and then a third time after that. Someone yelled at the player, and he
finally took his shot, and scored what would prove to be the game-winning goal.

<div id="sol-47" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The players in the game are blind, playing 5v5. The player was uncertain about
the direction of the goal. The sharp noise was a coach striking one goal post,
then the other, then the first one again, with an iron bar. Finally, the guide
stands directly behind the goal and call to the player, who then can take his
shot.

## Episode 46 - The 1925 Serum Run to Nome

We generally consider ourselves to be a lot smarter and better educated than
the people who lived in the prehistoric periods of the Stone Age, Bronze Age and
Iron Age. But what was it that the men and women did in those times that no man
or woman has managed to achieve for the last 4000 years?

<div id="sol-46" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

Domesticating an animal. People in prehistoric times domesticated many species,
both for farms and at home: cows, pigs, horses, sheep, goats, dogs, and cats.

There's a bit of an asterisk on this one, since it's not clear when eg. ferrets
or rats were domesticated as pets. On the other hand, there's much less
difference between a wild rat and domesticated rat than a wild boar and a
farmyard pig.
</div>

<div id="followup-46-1" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Follow-up - Episode 47

Researchers in Russia have been working on domesticating the silver fox since
the 1950s, which is well-documented.

The foxes were originally aggressive to humans, but after only a few generations
they resemble friendly dogs - they wag their tails, seek affectionate contact
with humans, and so on.

Darwin had noted that when a species is domesticated, there are phenotypic
changes - changes to colour, size, and so on. The researchers domesticating the
foxes found this too - they now have floppier ears and spotted coats. Curiously,
the researchers weren't selecting for those traits, just for their temperament.

These foxes are available as pets, but they're still quite expensive. They are
very cute, though. There are charming videos on YouTube.

A man and a woman get married. After the wedding, the wife goes to their home,
while the husband stays at the reception for some time. He then goes home, where
he drowns in front of his wife. She does nothing to help him. How did he drown,
and who was the man?


<div id="sol-45" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

This is how Attilla the Hun died, in 453 CE. He came home from the wedding
drunk, hit a tent pole, broke his nose, and fell on his back. Alcohol thins the
blood, and he drowned in the nosebleed. The marriage was unlikely to be a
voluntary one, so his new wife either did not want to help him, or perhaps
didn't realize he was dying, rather than just passed out.

Catherine is out shopping one day when she is astonished to see an airplane
flying upside down. Soon afterwards, because of the events triggered by this
incident, Catherine no longer has her job.


<div id="sol-44" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

She did not see a real aircraft, but instead one of the famous "inverted Jenny"
postage stamps. This 1918 stamp depicted a Curtiss JN-4 biplane, but the
aircraft was inverted, while the text remained upright.

Only one pane of 100 stamps with the inverted image was ever found, so the
stamps are extremely rare. Most are sold for prices from US$125,000 to $600,000, though a particularly fine example sold May 31, 2016 for US$1,175,000 million.

Catherine spotted an Inverted Jenny on an old letter in an antique shop,
recognized it as valuable, bought it for a few dollars, sold it for a fortune,
and retired from her job.

The Pentagon building, among its many peculiar characteristics, has twice
the number of bathrooms and toilets that an office building of its size and
capacity would normally have.

<div id="sol-43" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

When the Pentagon was built in 1941-3, racial segregation was still in place in
Virginia. The building was constructed accordingly with separate eating and
bathroom facilities. Segregation was ended in the armed forces in 1941. As
the Pentagon neared completion President Roosevelt toured it, and ordered the
removal of the "whites only" signs.

Daniel is an unmarried man who lives alone. He owns a car that works perfectly
well, and is driven only by him. However, to make his driving more convenient,
Daniel decides to buy another car, just like the one he has, which will also be
driven only by him. Why?

<div id="sol-42" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

In 1989, Mexico City introduced new laws to help control traffic congestion and
pollution. The laws limited which cars could drive on which days of the week,
based on the last digit of their license plate.

Daniel, like many real residents of Mexico City, has adopted the simple
expedient of buying an extra car with a different last digit.

- Source: Story about Thales of Miletus, ancient Greek philosopher.

There was a salt mine, and mules were used to carry salt out of the mine. One
day a mule slipped and fell into a stream while carrying its load of salt. The
salt dissolved, and the mule found that the load was lighter. From then on, when
they got to the stream, this mule would lie down in the stream and the salt
would dissolve. It fell to Thales to cure the mule of this habit. How did he do
it?

<div id="sol-41-1" class="fold" markdown="1">

He filled the mule's pack with something that would be much heavier when wet:
sponges.

- True story.

Polish chess grandmaster Miguel Najdorf had a brilliant facility for "blindfold
chess" - playing without sight of the board. He played exhibitions where he
played dozens of blindfold games at once, keeping all of them in his head. His
record was 45 simultaneous opponents, and he is considered probably one of the
top 5 all-time blindfold chess players.

The unusual part is that he only played in this way for a few years, and then
stopped. Why did he only play blindfolded for a short time?

<div id="sol-41-2" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

Najdorf, a Jew, was in Buenos Aires for a chess conference when the Nazis
invaded Poland in 1939. Unable to return home, he devised a way to announce
indirectly to his family in Poland that he was alive and well. He played these
big exhibitions of blindfold chess so that his family might see the news
coverage.

The second exhibition, in Brazil in 1947, is where he played 45 simultaneous
games. Of the 45 games, he won 39, drew 4 and lost 2, which is a record that
stood for 64 years.

### Follow-up - Episode 43

Natan Sharanski was a chess prodigy in his youth. He was a *refusenik* in the
Soviet Union, and spent 9 years in prison there. Some of his time in prison was
spent in solitary confinement. He recorded in his autobiography that he played
many chess games against himself in his head, and credits that practice with
preserving his sanity.

A young woman goes to a nightclub and tries to have fun. Someone slips a pill
into her drink without her noticing. After she finishes it, a dramatic change
comes over her. An hour later, she departs the club with a strange man who had
previously filled her with fear. Her sister is also at the club, and watches the
situation unfold, but does nothing to prevent it. Why not?

<div id="sol-40" class="fold" markdown="1">

Both sisters suffer from social anxiety disorder. The sister takes a
prescription drug to help manage her anxiety, but the woman dismisses it as a
placebo. So one night, the sister slips the pill into her drink to demonstrate
the drug's effectiveness.

- True story.

During World War 2, German anti-aircraft fire was inflicting heavy losses on
Allied bombers. Officials wanted to protect the planes with armour, but
armouring an entire aircraft would make it too heavy to fly. So they made a
study of returning planes, noted the areas that showed the most damage, and
planned to armour those areas. A mathematician considered this plan and
suggested an alternative that would produce a better outcome. What was it?


<div id="sol-39-1" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

Since the returning planes had survived the damage they had suffered, armouring
those areas would not be the best help. Instead, they should armour the areas
that no surviving plane showed damage to, on the theory that damage there tended
to be fatal.

In 2004, the band They Might Be Giants released a song, never before available,
on their new album. Yet if they had owned one of the earlier albums, a fan could
have heard the song in 1999.


<div id="sol-39-2" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The song is simply another reversed. *On Earth, my Nina*, released in 1999 on
the album *Long Tall Weekend* is merely an inversion of *Thunderbird*, which
came out in 2004 on *The Spine*. The songs are exactly the same, except for a
redubbed vocal track for clarity.

Curiously, the song was originally written as *Thunderbird*, and they released
the reversed version first as *On Earth, my Nina*.

Pierre went skydiving near his home in Dallas, Texas. As a result, Pierre saved
his brother's life. Strangely, though, his brother lived in Boston and hadn't
seen or spoken to his brother Pierre for many years. How could this miracle have
taken place?

<div id="sol-39-3" class="fold" markdown="1">

If you look at the western edge of South Dakota, where it borders Montana and
Wyoming, you'll see a mostly straight line with a kink of about one mile, where
the borders of Montana and Wyoming don't line up. The kink does not benefit any
of the states, or local landowners, and no other states are involved. Why is the
kink there?


<div id="sol-39-4" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The answer lies in 19th-century surveying accuracy. Two different teams surveyed
the borders. In 1877 one team surveyed the border with Wyoming, and set it. In
1885, another figured the border with Montana. But the two surveys don't line
up. Rather than pay to redo the whole survey, they added the kink.

Herb gets a job in a new city. On the day of his move, Herb causes a traffic jam
without ever leaving his home. How did Herb create such a monumental
disturbance?

<div id="sol-39-6" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

Herb lives on a houseboat. While moving his houseboat, he passed under a
drawbridge. The boat was too big for the bridge, and got stuck. Therefore, Herb
caused a traffic jam (because the bridge was raised for a long time) without
ever leaving his home.

In 1930, two men drove from New York to Los Angeles, and then back to New York,
in a Ford motor car. The outbound leg of the journey, a total of 3,340 miles,
took them 18 days. They drove on normal roads, and the car was not remarkable.
But because of this journey, these two men hold a world record that endures to
this day. What is it?


<div id="sol-39-7" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

They drove backwards. It's the fastest speed across the United States in
reverse. (Average speed about 10 miles per hour.)

They traveled day and night, sleeping in a customized seat in the car.

Mr. and Mrs. Jones were young and active people. Their next door neighbour, Mrs.
Jackson, was a 93-year-old invalid. One day, they asked her into their house to
do something that neither of them could do. What did they need her to do?


<div id="sol-39-8" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

They needed her to witness the signing of a contract. Since both the Joneses
were party to the contract, they needed an outside witness.

A man enters a monastery, greets the abbot, and begins conversing with the
monks. One of them does not respond, however, which the abbot explains by
telling the visitor that the monk has taken a vow of silence. The visitor thinks
for a moment, then speaks a single word. Nobody says anything, but immediately
the visitor pulls out a gun and shoots the silent monk. Why?

<div id="sol-37" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The visitor is a German Gestapo officer during the Second World War. The
monastery is in Italy, and the abbot and most of the monks are Italian. The monk
the visitor shot was a fleeing American spy. The American doesn't speak Italian,
so the abbot pretends that he has taken a vow of silence. The German visitor
speaks the American's name, he says nothing but visibly reacts to the name, and
the German shoots him.

In the presence of witnesses, a man draws a pistol and shoots his brother dead.
After firing this fatal shot, he drops the gun and bursts into tears. The police
arrive on the scene, establish that the man deliberately murdered his brother,
but don't arrest him. Why not?

<div id="sol-35-2" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The brothers are conjoined, or Siamese, twins. The shooter is planning to commit
suicide, and he shoots his brother first so his brother doesn't have to witness
his death. By the time the police arrive, both brothers are dead, so there's no
one to arrest.

Two cars made their along a winding country road and came to an abrupt stop at a
park gate. Seven men got out of the cars, and had started along a footpath when
it began to rain. Six of the men began to walk faster to get out of the rain,
but the seventh man couldn't be bothered. Ironically, it was the seventh man who
remained dry while the other six got soaked. Since all seven men arrived at
their destination together, how is this possible?

<div id="sol-35-3" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The seventh man is a corpse in a coffin, being carried by the other six. The
park is a cemetary. So they arrive together, and the seventh man is dry.

A ship sets out on its maiden voyage. Just before arriving at its destination,
the ship is involved in a serious accident, and wrecked. Although no one is
injured in the wreck, the accident is very costly and highly embarrassing. Later
it turns out that if the owners of the ship hadn't been Americans, the accident
probably would not have happened.

<div id="sol-35-4" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The lateral thinking trick here is to realize that the ship in the story is
actually a spaceship. This is the true story of the Mars Climate Orbiter,
launched in 1998, in order to study the Martian climate and atmosphere. The
ship's voyage of over nine months from Earth to Mars went smoothly, but on
September 23, 1999, as NASA engineers attempted to put the spacecraft into orbit
around Mars, contact with the orbiter was lost.

Over the next two days, NASA tried to regain contact with the spacecraft, but
failed. On September 25 the mission was declared a failure. The investigations
that followed revealed that the orbiter had been inserted into the Martian
atmosphere far closer to the planet than intended. The result was either that
the spacecraft was buffetted and destroyed completely by the atmosphere, or that
it fell out of orbit and drifted out of control toward the Sun.

The most embarrassing discovery, however, was that the accident had happened due
to a simple miscalculation. It turned out that one team working on the orbital
software had made their calculations in metric units, Newtons per second, while
another team had used English units, pounds per second. As a result, the
thrusters putting the ship into orbit had fired with more than four times the
thrust intended, pushing the ship 170km closer to the planet than intended, and
wrecking the spacecraft. The project losses were estimated to be over $327
million.

A man who disliked smoking lit a cigarette in order to reach his goal more
quickly. How did it help?

<div id="sol-35-5" class="fold" markdown="1">

The man was riding a bus on which smoking was not allowed. The nearest bus stops
before and after his destination were both a long walk away. By lighting the
cigarette as he approached the nearest point to his destination, he contrived to
be kicked off the bus between the stops, close to his destination.

Part of the police manual gives instructions in a language that none of the
policemen speaks. Why?

<div id="sol-34" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The instructions are commands meant to be given by K-9 officers to police dogs.
The dogs are trained in another language, such as German, and the manual teaches
these commands to the officers.

Part of the idea is that this makes it unlikely that a suspect or bystander can
confuse the dog by giving conflicting commands. It may be more that many dogs
are imported having been trained in Germany or elsewhere, and having learned
German commands.

In 2008, all three of Montana's rabbis were involved in a joint Hanukkah
celebration at the state capitol building. After the ceremony, a Helena police
officer went up to one of the rabbis and introduced his bomb security dog,
Miky. The officer, John Fosket, had been having a problem because Miky had
been trained in Israel and only responded to Hebrew, which Fosket did not
speak.

Foscitt had been given a list of a dozen Hebrew commands, but Miky was not
responding properly. Fosket had tried to use a Hebrew instructional audiobook
from the library to improve his pronunciation, but Miky still wasn't responding
properly.

So Fosket sought out the rabbi, and with his help, improved his pronuciation to
the point where Miky responded fully to his commands.

In Australia, a perfectly good building was demolished, and an almost identical
one erected on exactly the same site. The original building was in good
condition, it had no defects, and there was no issue of safety or planning
permission. Why was it demolished?

<div id="sol-33" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The building was the Australian mint. Enough gold dust from the manufacture of
coins had become impregnated in the walls of the building to make it profitable
to knock it down, harvest the gold, and reconstruct it.

This is sort of based on a true story, but it seems that the value of the gold
was only some $32,000. It's also not clear how to recover the gold dust from the
demolished structure. For the purposes of the puzzle, it's conceivable that
there could be enough gold dust to cover the reconstruction cost.

Why did a man go to great trouble to bury in the desert 15 brand new
Mercedes-Benz cars, all greased and wrapped in plastic?

<div id="sol-29" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

This was in the Sinai Peninsula after the Six Day War between Egypt and Israel.
Israel had seized large parts of the desert from Egypt, but it was probable it
would be handed back to Egypt.

Due to import duties, Merdeces cars were much cheaper in Israel than in Egypt.
It was becoming clear that the desert would be returned to Egypt. By burying the
cars and waiting until the border moved across them, they were effectively
exported.

David Brooks wrote in to point out the Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus. This is a
fictional animal, an octopus that supposedly lives in the trees of the temperate
rainforests of the Pacific Northwest.

It is a hoax developed by a group of education researchers at the University of
Connecticut. They built a detailed website about the supposedly endangered
creature, describing its habits and life cycle. It has photos and testimonials
and so on. It was showed to 7th grade students in Connecticut, to see if they
could detect the hoax. Very few caught on to it, and some even protested that
the octopus was real after being told it was a hoax.

This incident has become a classic example of how straightforward it is to make
a comprehensive, professional and convincing website making any claim at all.
The site had deliberate hints that it was a hoax, such as giving the names of
the tree octopus in Sasquatch and Yeti. But on the whole, it was detailed and
had lots of scientific terms, links to other sites, and so on.

During the Second World War, there was a footbridge over a ravine between
Germany and Switzerland. It was guarded by a German sentry. His orders were to
shoot anyone trying to escape over the bridge, and to turn back anyone who did
not have a signed authorization to cross. The sentry was on the German side of
the bridge. He sat in a sentry post and came out every 3 minutes to survey the
bridge.

A woman desperately needed to escape from Germany to Switzerland. She could not
possibly get a pass. She knew that she could sneak past the sentry while he was
in the sentry post, but that it would take between 5 and 6 minutes to cross the
entire bridge. There was no place to hide on or under the bridge, so the guard
would be easily able to shoot her if he saw her on the bridge escaping to
Switzerland. How did she escape across the bridge?


<div id="sol-22" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

She snuck past the sentry and hurried across the bridge. She then turned and
started walking back toward the German side. The sentry came out and saw her,

A man tells his nephew that his dog will be shot. The boy is overwhelmed with
grief, but discovers a little later that the dog is fine. What's going on?


<div id="sol-21" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The boy is Jackie Cooper, the child actor of the 1930s. This is during filming
of *Skippy* in 1931. The film was directed by Cooper's uncle, and contains a
scene where Cooper's character had to cry convincingly. Cooper was a skilled
actor, but the scene wasn't working out. He was 9 years old and had brought his
dog to the set.

His uncle arranged for the security guard to take the dog outside while drawing
his gun, and then fire into the air. Cooper sobbed uncontrollably, almost too
much for the scene. His uncle said that if he calmed down and did the scene
quickly, there might still be time to save his dog.

Cooper was nominated for Best Actor, and his uncle *won* Best Director.

The two thieves are not working together. Each separately disguises himself,
breaks in, and steals a painting. In order to frame the other, each disguised
himself skillfully as the other thief. So the security footage shows the two
actual thieves, disguised as each other. Both were arrested correctly, though
who actually stole which painting would be a surprise to the authorities.

In a certain place, the local authorities, in order to increase tourism, have
made the price of electricity higher. Why?

<div id="sol-16" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The "certain place" is Niagara Falls. The falls are diverted through
hydroelectric generators overnight, generating cheap electricity. Diverting the
falls all the time would lower the price of electricity, but due to the tourist
demand, the falls flow freely during the day.

Canada and the United States in fact have a treaty laying out all the complex
rules for when the falls can be diverted and how much, depending on the tourist
season, etc.

Joan and her boyfriend Fred, who lived in Stockport, were invited and given one
of the ornate, if old-fashioned, bedroom suites for their stay. The party lasted
the whole weekend and was a delightful affair. The catering was superb, and the
congenial atmosphere turned the get-together of old friends into an
unforgettable experience.

On Monday morning, most guests had departed, and Joan
and Fred prepared for their journey home. Having finished their packing, Joan
looked around as if searching for something. She finally turned to Fred and
asked, jokingly, "You haven't by any chance drunk the glass of water on the
dressing table?" Fred nodded, and all of a sudden, pandemonium. Joan had to
phone the automobile association's rescue service. Less than an hour later, an
AA man arrived, hitched their car to his breakdown van, and towed the
embarrassed couple home, where they arrived after a two and a half hour journey.

<div id="sol-15" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The glass contained water, and Joan's contact lenses. Fred swallowed them
along with the water. Joan could not drive safely without them, and Fred did not
know how to drive. The other guests had all departed, so no one else was
available to drive them. Therefore they were compelled to call the AA and get
towed.

Sometime after Salvador Dali's death, his younger brother became famous as a
surrealist painter. This younger brother had great international success, and
the word "genius" was used to describe him. His name was Dali, and he did not
change it. Yet today, the world remembers only one Dali, and few people even
know that he had a brother. Why is this?

<div id="sol-14" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

Two brothers in the same family were both named Salvador Dali. The
elder of them lived only until 7 years of age. 9 months later, his parents had
another son. They also named him Salvador, and this younger brother is the one
the world knows as the surrealist painter Salvador Dali. They were never alive
at the same time.
