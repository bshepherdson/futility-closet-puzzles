# Futility Closet Lateral Thinking Puzzles

This is a list of the lateral thinking puzzles heard in the Futility Closet
Podcast.

Solutions (and follow-up with spoilers) are hidden behind a fold; you can click
to reveal them.


## Episode 22 - The Devil's Hoofmarks

- Sharon reading, Greg guessing.
- Segment intro 29:16.

During the Second World War, there was a footbridge over a ravine between
Germany and Switzerland. It was guarded by a German sentry. His orders were to
shoot anyone trying to escape over the bridge, and to turn back anyone who did
not have a signed authorization to cross. The sentry was on the German side of
the bridge. He sat in a sentry post and came out every 3 minutes to survey the
bridge.

A woman desperately needed to escape from Germany to Switzerland. She could not
possibly get a pass. She knew that she could sneak past the sentry while he was
in the sentry post, but that it would take between 5 and 6 minutes to cross the
entire bridge. There was no place to hide on or under the bridge, so the guard
would be easily able to shoot her if he saw her on the bridge escaping to
Switzerland. How did she escape across the bridge?


<div id="sol-22" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

She snuck past the sentry and hurried across the bridge. She then turned and
started walking back toward the German side. The sentry came out and saw her,
apparently crossing from Switzerland to Germany. She did not have the necessary
papers to enter Germany, so he turned her back across the bridge.

## Episode 21 - A Gallant German Fighter Ace

- Segment intro 26:01

- True story.

A man tells his nephew that his dog will be shot. The boy is overwhelmed with
grief, but discovers a little later that the dog is fine. What's going on?


<div id="sol-21" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The boy is Jackie Cooper, the child actor of the 1930s. This is during filming
of *Skippy* in 1931. The film was directed by Cooper's uncle, and contains a
scene where Cooper's character had to cry convincingly. Cooper was a skilled
actor, but the scene wasn't working out. He was 9 years old and had brought his
dog to the set.

His uncle arranged for the security guard to take the dog outside while drawing
his gun, and then fire into the air. Cooper sobbed uncontrollably, almost too
much for the scene. His uncle said that if he calmed down and did the scene
quickly, there might still be time to save his dog.

Cooper was nominated for Best Actor, and his uncle *won* Best Director.

## Episode 20 - Life Imitates Science Fiction

- Sharon reading, Greg guessing.
- Segment intro 27:45.
- Puzzle begins 28:21, duration 7:17.
- Source: Listener Eric Tressler wrote this puzzle, inspired by the previous
  podcasts.


A famous artist's work is on exhibition in a city's museum. One night, the
city's two most devious and infamous thieves decide to break in, and each makes
off with one painting. They are both wearing absolutely perfect disguises and
leave no trace except for security camera footage, which is discovered in the
morning. The next day, both men are arrested. How were they caught?


<div id="sol-20" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The two thieves are not working together. Each separately disguises himself,
breaks in, and steals a painting. In order to frame the other, each disguised
himself skillfully as the other thief. So the security footage shows the two
actual thieves, disguised as each other. Both were arrested correctly, though
who actually stole which painting would be a surprise to the authorities.

## Episode 19 - Testing the Post Office

- Greg reading, Sharon guessing.
- Segment intro 27:48.
- Puzzle begins 28:18, duration 4:12.

Bernard was the president of a major Wall Street bank. One morning when he got
on a crowded train he was extremely worried. When the train stopped and he
alighted, he felt sick but was no longer worried. Why not?

<div id="sol-19" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The train is not a conventional train for transportation, but rather a roller
coaster. He had promised to take his nephew on a roller coaster, and the boy was
eager to go, but Bernard hated roller coasters. Hence his worrying, and feeling
sick but no longer worried when the ride was over.

## Episode 18 - The Mystery of the Disappearing Airmen

- Sharon reading, Greg guessing.
- Segment intro 25:58.
- Puzzle begins 26:30, duration 3:40.

A man wakes up feeling thirsty. He goes downstairs, opens the fridge, gets a
bottle of water from inside it, drinks it, goes upstairs, turns off the light,
and goes to bed. In the morning he finds out hundreds of people died. How did
this happen?


<div id="sol-18" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The man is a lighthouse keeper. When the puzzle says he "turns off the light",
it means *the* light, the light of the lighthouse. Without the guide of the
lighthouse, a ship ran aground and sank, killing hundreds of people.

## Episode 17 - An Aircraft Carrier Made of Ice

- Greg reading, Sharon guessing.
- Segment intro 21:58.

Two men lie dead in a cabin in the woods. No tracks lead either to or away from
the cabin. What happened?

<div id="sol-17" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The cabin is not a building, but the cabin of an airplane. The two men are the
pilots of the aircraft, which crashed in the woods, killing them both.

## Episode 16 - A Very Popular Sack of Flour

In a certain place, the local authorities, in order to increase tourism, have
made the price of electricity higher. Why?

<div id="sol-16" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The "certain place" is Niagara Falls. The falls are diverted through
hydroelectric generators overnight, generating cheap electricity. Diverting the
falls all the time would lower the price of electricity, but due to the tourist
demand, the falls flow freely during the day.

Canada and the United States in fact have a treaty laying out all the complex
rules for when the falls can be diverted and how much, depending on the tourist
season, etc.

## Episode 15 - The Flannan Isles Mystery

- Greg reading, Sharon guessing.
- Segment intro 25:19.
- Puzzle begins 26:12, duration 4:12.

- True story.

Joan and her boyfriend Fred, who lived in Stockport, were invited and given one
of the ornate, if old-fashioned, bedroom suites for their stay. The party lasted
the whole weekend and was a delightful affair. The catering was superb, and the
congenial atmosphere turned the get-together of old friends into an
unforgettable experience.

On Monday morning, most guests had departed, and Joan
and Fred prepared for their journey home. Having finished their packing, Joan
looked around as if searching for something. She finally turned to Fred and
asked, jokingly, "You haven't by any chance drunk the glass of water on the
dressing table?" Fred nodded, and all of a sudden, pandemonium. Joan had to
phone the automobile association's rescue service. Less than an hour later, an
AA man arrived, hitched their car to his breakdown van, and towed the
embarrassed couple home, where they arrived after a two and a half hour journey.

<div id="sol-15" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

The glass contained water, and Joan's contact lenses. Fred swallowed them
along with the water. Joan could not drive safely without them, and Fred did not
know how to drive. The other guests had all departed, so no one else was
available to drive them. Therefore they were compelled to call the AA and get
towed.

Sometime after Salvador Dali's death, his younger brother became famous as a
surrealist painter. This younger brother had great international success, and
the word "genius" was used to describe him. His name was Dali, and he did not
change it. Yet today, the world remembers only one Dali, and few people even
know that he had a brother. Why is this?

<div id="sol-14" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

Two brothers in the same family were both named Salvador Dali. The
elder of them lived only until 7 years of age. 9 months later, his parents had
another son. They also named him Salvador, and this younger brother is the one
the world knows as the surrealist painter Salvador Dali. They were never alive
at the same time.
