Sometime after Salvador Dali's death, his younger brother became famous as a
surrealist painter. This younger brother had great international success, and
the word "genius" was used to describe him. His name was Dali, and he did not
change it. Yet today, the world remembers only one Dali, and few people even
know that he had a brother. Why is this?

<div id="sol-14" class="fold" markdown="1">
### Solution

Two brothers in the same family were both named Salvador Dali. The
elder of them lived only until 7 years of age. 9 months later, his parents had
another son. They also named him Salvador, and this younger brother is the one
the world knows as the surrealist painter Salvador Dali. They were never alive
at the same time.
